## 12. Best Fit - Memory Allocation Methods for Fixed Partition

1. **Input** memory blocks and processes with sizes.
2. **Initialize** all memory blocks as free.
3. **Start** by picking each process and find the minimum block size that can be assigned to the current process:
   - Find `min(blockSize[1], blockSize[2], ..., blockSize[n])` such that it is greater than `processSize[current]`.
   - If a suitable block is found, **assign** it to the current process.
4. If no suitable block is found, **leave** that process and continue checking the subsequent processes.
