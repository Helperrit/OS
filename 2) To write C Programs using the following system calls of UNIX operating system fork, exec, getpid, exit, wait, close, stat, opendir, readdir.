## Algorithm

1. **Start the program.**
2. Create a `struct dirent` to store directory entries.
3. Declare the necessary variables, such as `buff` and a pointer `dptr` for directory handling.
4. Get the directory name as input from the user or another source.
5. Open the specified directory.
6. Read the contents of the directory and print them one by one.
7. Close the directory after reading.
