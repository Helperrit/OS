## 10. Banker's Algorithm for Deadlock Avoidance

1. **Start** the program.
2. **Declare** the memory for the process.
3. **Read** the number of processes, resources, allocation matrix, and available matrix.
4. **Compare** each process using the Banker's algorithm:
   - Check if the process can be safely completed with the available resources.
5. If the process is in a **safe state**, then it is **not** a deadlock process; otherwise, it is a **deadlock process**.
6. **Produce** the result indicating the state of the process (safe or deadlocked).
7. **Stop** the program.
